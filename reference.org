This document is the primary reference for the Carth programming
language. It is updated on a best-effort basis. It should be valid and
complete, but it may not be.

** Global variable definitions
   Global variables are defined at the top-level by using either one
   of the two implicitly typed /variable ~define~/ and /function
   ~define~/ special forms, or their explicitly typed ~define:~
   counterparts.

   Global variables are practically equivalent to local variables, in
   all respects but scope.

*** Examples
    #+BEGIN_SRC carth
    ;; First form. Implicitly typed variable definition.
    ;;
    ;; Bind the global variable ~id-iv~ to the identity function. No
    ;; explicit type signature is given - it is statically inferred by the
    ;; typechecker to be the equivalent of ~(forall [a] (Fun a a))~
    (define id-iv
      (fun x x))

    ;; Second form. Implicitly typed function definition.
    ;;
    ;; Again, the identity function, equivalent to the defition above, but
    ;; using the more convenient function definition syntax.
    (define (id-if x)
      x)

    ;; Third form. Explicitly typed variable definition.
    ;;
    ;; Explicit type signature is given. The type must properly be a
    ;; polytype (aka /type scheme/) to be valid and instantiable for any
    ;; monotype.
    (define: id-ev
        (forall (a) (Fun a a))
      (fun x x))

    ;; Fourth form. Explicitly typed function definition.
    (define: (id-ef x)
        (forall (a) (Fun a a))
      x)
    #+END_SRC

** Type definitions
   Algebraic datatypes (aka tagged/discriminated unions) are defined
   at the top-level with the ~type~ special form. Roughly equivalent
   to ~data~ in Haskell and ~enum~ in Rust.

   Recursive datatypes must contain a ~Box~ indirection to be
   representable in memory with a finite size.

*** Examples
    #+BEGIN_SRC carth
    ;; First form. Monomorphic datatype definition.
    ;;
    ;; ~Age~ only has one variant, and as such can be seen as a "wrapper"
    ;; around ~Int~, restricting its usage.
    (type Age
      (Age Int))

    ;; Second form. Polymorphic datatype definition.
    ;;
    ;; ~List~ has two variants, representing that a list can either be
    ;; empty, or a pair of a head and a tail. Note that we must have a
    ;; ~Box~ indirection so that it doesn't have infinite size.
    (type (List' a)
      (Cons' a (Box (List' a)))
      Nil')
    #+END_SRC

* TODO Expressions
** Literals
- Unit :: ~unit~ is the only value inhibiting the type ~Unit~,
          equivalent to ~()~ in Haskell and Rust.

- Int :: 64-bit signed integer literal. Example: ~42~.
- Double :: 64-bit double precision floating point literal. Example: ~-13.37~.
- Char :: 4-byte UTF-32 Character literal. Example: ~'a'~, ~'維'~, ~'🔥'~.
- String :: UTF-8 string literals. At the moment, generates to static
            arrays. Will likely be changed. Example: ~"Hello, World!"~, ~"😄😦🐱"~.
- Bool :: ~True~ or ~False~.
** TODO Variable

** TODO Function application

** TODO Conditional

** TODO Anonymous-function / Lambda expression / Closure

** TODO Let

** Type ascription
   Type ascriptions are primarily used to:
   - increase readability when the type of an expression is not obvious;
   - assert at compile-time that an expression is of or can specialize to the given type;
   - or specialize the type of a generic expression, restricting its usage.

*** Example
    #+BEGIN_SRC carth
    (define (id-int x)
      (: x Int))
    ;; Inferred type of ~id-int~: (Fun Int Int)
    #+END_SRC

** Match
   Pattern matching. Used to deconstruct algebraic datatypes.

   Note that the cases of a match-expression must be exhaustive and
   non-redundant.

*** Example
    :PROPERTIES:
    :CUSTOM_ID: Match-Example
    :END:
    #+BEGIN_SRC carth
    (type Foo
      Bar
      Baz)
    (type (Pair' a b)
      (Pair' a b))

    ;; Ok
    (define (fst pair)
      (match pair
        (case (Pair' a _) a)))
    #+END_SRC

    #+BEGIN_SRC carth :tangle no
    ;; Error. Redundant pattern. ~Pair _ _~ already covered by previous
    ;; pattern ~_~
    (define (redundant pair)
      (match pair
        (case _ 1)
        (case (Pair' x y) 2)))

    ;; Error. Inexhaustive pattern. All cases not covered, specifically
    ;; ~Bar~
    (define (inexhaustive foo)
      (match foo
        (case Baz 123)))
    #+END_SRC

** FunMatch
   Syntax sugar for a ~match~ in a lambda. Equivalent to ~\case~
   (LambdaCase) in Haskell. ~(fun-match cases...)~ translates to ~(fun
   VAR (match VAR cases...))~ where ~VAR~ is a uniquely internally
   generated variable that cannot be expressed by the user (which
   means it won't shadow any other binding).

*** Example
    #+BEGIN_SRC carth
    ;; Two versions of `fst`, which returns the first value of a pair
    ;;
    ;; using normal `match`
    (define (fst-nofun p)
      (match p
        (case (Pair a _) a)))
    ;; and using `fun-match`
    (define fst-fun
      (fun-match
        (case (Pair a _) a)))
    #+END_SRC

** Constructor
   By applying a constructor to some arguments, or just presenting it
   literally in the case of a nullary constructor, a value of the
   associated algebraic datatype is produced. Constructors of arity >
   0 behave like n-ary functions: curried and the whole shebang.

*** Example
    #+BEGIN_SRC carth
    ;; The following datatype definition will make available the
    ;; constructors ~UPUnit~ and ~UPPair~ in the environment.
    (type UnitOrPair
      UPUnit
      (UPPair Int Int))


    ;; The ~UPUnit~ constructor is nullary, and will construct a
    ;; ~UnitOrPair~ just presented literally.
    (define: upunit
        UnitOrPair
      UPUnit)

    ;; The ~UPPair~ constructor is binary, and takes two arguments to
    ;; construct a ~UnitOrPair~. It behaves like a function of two ~Int~
    ;; arguments, returning a ~UnitOrPair~.
    (define: uppair''
        (Fun Int Int UnitOrPair)
      UPPair)
    (define: uppair'
        (Fun Int UnitOrPair)
      (UPPair 3))
    (define: uppair
        UnitOrPair
      (uppair' 5))
    #+END_SRC
* Patterns
  Patterns are used to conditionally deconstruct values of algebraic
  datatypes in pattern-matching contexts.

  There are 3 kinds of patterns: nullary constructors, n-ary
  constructions, and variable bindings.

* TODO Literate Carth
  :PROPERTIES:
  :CUSTOM_ID: Literate-Carth
  :END:
  Carth has native support for literate programming with Org
  mode. Either use Emacs with Babel in Org-mode for an interactive
  session, or interpret/compile the file with ~carth~ just like a
  normal ~.carth~ file!

** Example
   Consider a file ~cool.org~ with the following content:

   #+BEGIN_SRC org
   ,#+TITLE: Literate Programming Rules!

   Literate programming is just really cool!

   ~carth~ will assume ~tangle~ = ~yes~ by default, but setting it
   explicitly won't hurt.

   ,#+BEGIN_SRC carth :tangle yes
   (define (main _)
     (printInt (id 1337)))
   ,#+END_SRC

   ,* The ~id~ function
     ~id~ is the identity function. It returns its argument unchanged.

     ,#+BEGIN_SRC carth
     (define (id x) x)
     ,#+END_SRC

   ,* How not to use ~id~
     Here is an example of how not to use ~id~. Note that this won't
     compile. We show this in a SRC block to get syntax highlighting etc,
     but as ~tangle~ is ~no~, this source block will be ignored by carth.

     ,#+BEGIN_SRC carth :tangle no
     (printInt id)
     ,#+END_SRC

   #+END_SRC

   When e.g. interpreting this file with ~carth i cool.org~, the Carth
   source will untangled from the rest of the document. Line numbers
   are preserved. The result of the untangling stage will be the
   following:

   #+BEGIN_SRC carth :tangle no








   (define (main _)
     (printInt (id 1337)))






   (define (id x) x)











   #+END_SRC

   And for completeness, the result of interpreting that will be ~1337~.
