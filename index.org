Welcome to the homepage of the Carth programming language!

* /WORK IN PROGRESS/
  Just as a little disclaimer: this project is in the very early
  stages of development, so there are no guarantees of stability etc.

* Why Carth?
  - Scheme-inspired syntax and feel
  - Static, Hindley-Milner typechecking Ã  la ML
  - Currying
  - LLVM-based backend
  - [[file:reference.org::#Literate-Carth][Native support for literate programming in Org-mode]]

* Documentation
  - [[file:guide.org][User guide]]
  - [[file:reference.org][Language reference]]

* Development
  All development on the Carth project happens openly on [[https://github.com/bryal/carth][Github in
  ~bryal/carth~]]. The source for this website is also on [[https://github.com/bryal/carth-website][Github in
  ~bryal/carth-website~]].

* Example
  Just to give you a quick taste. More examples can be found in the
  [[https://github.com/bryal/carth/tree/master/examples/][~examples~ directory in the repository]].

  #+BEGIN_SRC carth
  (import std)

  (define main fizzbuzz)

  (define (fizzbuzz Unit)
    (for (range 1 100)
         (<o display fizzbuzz')))

  (define (fizzbuzz' n)
    (match (Pair (divisible? n 3) (divisible? n 5))
      (case (Pair False False) (my-show-int n))
      (case (Pair True False) "Fizz")
      (case (Pair False True) "Buzz")
      (case (Pair True True) "Fizzbuzz")))

  (define my-show-int
    (fmatch
      (case 1 "one")
      (case 2 "two")
      (case n (show-int n))))

  Note that by default, all programs written in Carth will have to be
  distributed under the AGPLv3 license as well, as not just the
  compiler itself, but also the standard library you include and the
  core library you link with are AGPLv3 licensed. Technically you
  could write your own standard library and core library with some
  non-copyleft license to avoid this, but I hope you won't! ;)
